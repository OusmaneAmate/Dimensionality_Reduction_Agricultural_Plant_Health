## Dimensionality_Reduction_Agricultural_Plan_Health
This repository contains code and data to replicate the experiments from the paper “Studying the impact of dimensionality reduction on machine learning and deep learning prediction of agricultural plant health.” It includes Deep Learning training pipelines, classic Machine Learning baselines, and processed data used for benchmarking.

## Repo structure
Processed_Data/ – prepared tabular datasets for experiments for onion, lettuce and carrot crops and related fungal diseases. Also contains a detailed description of the raw datasets.
ML_Training/ – Code to generate baseline models using classical machine learning (Decision tree, Random forest and K-nn).
DL_Training/ – Code to generate baseline models using  deep learning (lstm, mlp- and rnn_gru).
